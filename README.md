An advanced machine learning system that predicts whether an approved loan will become a **Post Due Obligation (PDO)** or remain **Current (CUR)**. This project was developed during my internship at **NBK Egypt** to enhance loan risk assessment and improve banking decision-making processes.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Loan PDO Predictor is a sophisticated risk assessment tool that analyzes customer profiles, loan characteristics, and financial metrics to predict loan performance. By identifying high-risk loans before they become problematic, this system helps financial institutions:

- **Reduce NPL ratios** by identifying potential defaults early
- **Optimize loan pricing** based on risk assessment
- **Improve portfolio management** through better risk segmentation
- **Enhance regulatory compliance** with Basel III requirements
- **Support data-driven lending decisions**

## 🔬 Problem Statement

Post Due Obligations (PDOs) represent loans that have missed payment schedules, potentially becoming Non-Performing Loans (NPLs). Early identification of such loans is crucial for:

- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive measures to prevent defaults
- **Capital Allocation**: Better reserves planning and regulatory compliance
- **Customer Relationship**: Early intervention and restructuring opportunities
- **Profitability**: Reduced write-offs and improved portfolio performance
